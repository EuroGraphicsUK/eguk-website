## The UK Chapter of Eurographics
Founded in 1981, EGUK is the UK branch of [Eurographics](http://www.eg.org/), a world-wide organisation devoted to the needs of professionals in computer graphics and all related visual disciplines. Membership of the UK Chapter comes from being an EG member living in the UK. The chapter organises an [annual conference](events) in the UK (around September) which is separate from the main [Eurographics conference](https://www.eg.org/wp/eg-events/) organised in April/May each year. The UK Chapter also occasionally organises one-day events. These events are on a smaller scale than the main Eurographics Workshops organised around Europe.
