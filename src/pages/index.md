# Welcome to EGUK
Founded in 1981, EGUK is the UK branch of [Eurographics](http://www.eg.org/), a world-wide organisation devoted to the needs of professionals in computer graphics and all related visual disciplines. Membership of the UK Chapter comes from being an EG member living in the UK.

The EGUK chapter organises an annual [conference](events) in the UK. This UK conference had been held in June, however since Eurographics moved to the Easter timeslot, we have moved the conference to early September. The UK Chapter also occasionally organises one-day events. These events are on a smaller scale than the main [Eurographics Workshops](https://www.eg.org/wp/eg-events/) organised around Europe.

## Next event:
### [CGVC2024](events/CGVC2024)

The [42nd conference](https://cgvc.org.uk/CGVC2024/) will be held over two days at the [City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/).

Conference chair: [Dr Mai Elshehaly](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/mai-elshehaly) ([City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/))

Programme chairs: [Dr Aidan Slingsby](https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/aidan-slingsby) ([City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/)) & [Dr David Hunter](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/staff-profiles/listing/profile/dah56/) ([City, University of London](https://www.city.ac.uk/))
